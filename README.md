##  Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and transformation on retail sales data
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib
- Visualize insights on sales, profit, discount impact, and regional performance
- Summarize business takeaways and potential actions for stakeholders

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and project sharing

##  Key Insights

### 1. **The West Region Generates the Most Sales**
The West consistently leads in total sales, though the South is more profitable due to fewer discounts and better margins.

### 2. **Discounts Negatively Impact Profit**
A scatter plot analysis shows a clear negative correlation between discount percentage and profit. High discounts (above 30%) often lead to losses.

### 3. **Loss-Making Sub-Categories Identified**
Products like **Tables**, **Bookcases**, and **Binders** consistently result in negative profits, especially when sold with steep discounts.

### 4. **Top Products Drive a Majority of Revenue**
A small number of products (Top 10) contribute disproportionately to revenue, suggesting focus areas for inventory and marketing.

### 5. **Regional Performance Varies**
The West and East regions generate the highest sales, while the Central region lags behind. Profit margins vary widely by location.
